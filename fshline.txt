fshline file.fsh              -> dump as bmp
fshline folder\index.fsh      -> load as bmp
fshline file.fsh -getidx      -> dump as DDS and PNG files for each object

replace the PNG with your custom image
delete the corresponding DDS, and it will import the PNG file
with the command
fshline file.fsh -setidx      -> import DDS or PNG file if dds is not there


fshline aamackie.fsh -export "texture!bhed"  aamackie.png
fshline aamackie.fsh -export "texture!bhed"  aamackie.psd

should get dtx1a files better.
